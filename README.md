This is the repository for the code used to analyse the data of my thesis, 'Engineering a Single-Cell Platform to Study Estrogen Receptor-α Regulation of the Genome in Breast Cancer Microenvironments.'

This has been grouped and tidied based on the type of file and the chapter they appear in to ease the navigation to a specific script of interest.

The code within the scripts, however, has not been edited to function in this arrangement, and more extensive changes to file paths would be needed to make it work. 

An alternative repository in its original, less organised, state can be found HERE XOXO. While this version is more difficult to navigate, it's possible to change the filepath to the location of that directory, and the code will run with minimal changes required.
